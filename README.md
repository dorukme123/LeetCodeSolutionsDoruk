[3232. Find if Digit Game Can Be Won]("https://github.com/dorukme123/LeetCodeSolutionsDoruk/blob/main/Python/3232.py")
- Language:
    - Python
- Description:
    - You are given an array of positive integers ```nums```.
    - Alice and Bob are playing a game. In the game, Alice can choose either all single-digit numbers or all double-digit numbers from ```nums```, and the rest of the numbers are given to Bob. Alice wins if the sum of her numbers is strictly greater than the sum of Bob's numbers.

[657. Robot Return to Origin]("https://github.com/dorukme123/LeetCodeSolutionsDoruk/blob/main/Python/657.py")
- Language:
    - Python
- Description:
    - There is a robot starting at the position ```(0, 0)```, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at ```(0, 0)``` after it completes its moves.
    - You are given a string ```moves``` that represents the move sequence of the robot where ```moves[i]``` represents its ```ith``` move. Valid moves are ```'R'``` (right), ```'L'``` (left), ```'U'``` (up), and ```'D'``` (down).
    - Return ```true``` if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or ```false``` otherwise.
    - **Note**: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. ```'R'``` will always make the robot move to the right once, ```'L'``` will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.
- Result:
    - Runtime 15ms | Memory 17.73mb | Passed

[2535. Difference Between Element Sum and Digit Sum of an Array]("https://github.com/dorukme123/LeetCodeSolutionsDoruk/blob/main/Python/2535.py")
- Language:
    - Python
- Description:
    - You are given a positive integer array ```nums```.
    - The **element sum** is the sum of all the elements in ```nums```.
    - The **digit sum** is the sum of all the digits (not necessarily distinct) that appear in ```nums```.
    - Return the **absolute** difference between the element sum and digit sum of ```nums```.
    - **Note** that the absolute difference between two integers ```x``` and ```y``` is defined as ```|x - y|```.
- Result:
